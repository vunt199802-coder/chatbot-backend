This is a no-code tool for creating chatbots for Telegram, complete with code generation features.

With this builder, you can make chatbots for Telegram without needing to know how to code. Plus, you can download the generated bot code for launching and tweaking it on your own.

Each chatbot you create with this tool is built from conversation scripts (dialogs) and ready-made software modules (plugins) that you can easily add to your bot.

#ðŸ’¬ Dialogs
Dialogs are the scripts for chatting with your bots. Each dialog is made up of blocks, which are the actions the bot performs. The builder lets you set up 6 types of actions for your bot:

- Send a text message to a user
- Send an image to a user
- Ask a user a question and wait for a specific type of response (text, number, email, phone number)
- Save data to a CSV file
- Send an email
- Make an API request
To help your bot know when to start a particular conversation with a user, youâ€™ll need to specify the type of event it should react to. You can choose from 3 event types:

- A user sends a specific text message
- A user sends a specific command
- A user clicks a button in the botâ€™s menu (two types of buttons: reply and inline)
- 
#ðŸ”‹ Plugins
Plugins are ready-to-go software modules you can easily add to your bots. Hereâ€™s what you can choose from:

- Statistics - adds functionality to view chatbot stats
- Tech Support - adds tech support features to the bot
- Catalog - adds product viewing and management features to the bot
- 
#ðŸš€ Code Generation
The builder lets you download the code for your chatbot as a ZIP archive. The generated bot code uses the aiogram library. To run your bot, youâ€™ll need to install Python and the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file found in the downloaded ZIP archive.
